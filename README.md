So, here we are. I haven't released anything really "public" in a long time, so let's share the source for this simple single page spun up in Next.JS, shall we?

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Sub-MOA Spoonies is, well.. Just go to [https://submoaspoonies.com](https://submoaspoonies.com) to learn what it is.

It's ultimately a project for advocacy and encouragement of a niche of a niche.. People who live with chronic illness (like me) who also enjoy precision rifle shooting (like me), but it's also a reminder that we can - and do - compete with the "normies" at times!

As far as tech goes, this is just a simple Next.js 13 site with TypeScript and Tailwinds (love me some Tailwinds now). TypeScript is honestly a bit extra for this, but I'm used to working in it so I figured why change anything.

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Notes on Deployment:

I just build it static on local and upload it to my hosting, so keep that in mind here. I'm not using Vercel because that's just.. More than what I need, and I already have good enough hosting for stuff like this.
