This readme is gonna be pretty basic; not a lot needed.

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Learn More

This is just a small landing page designed to be easily sharable for undecided/centrist folks of any political leanings in the US; targeting the extremists or traditional right-wing folks is going to be a failing prospect without a more strategic approach. This focuses on a handful of simple core issues with easily-digestible, non-biased sources to back them up.

Check it out at the [US Political Issues landing page](https://uspoliticalissues.com).

As far as tech goes, this is just a simple Next.js 13 site with TypeScript and Tailwinds (love me some Tailwinds now). TypeScript is honestly a bit extra for this, but I'm used to working in it so I figured why change anything.

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Notes on Deployment:

I just build it static on local and upload it to my hosting, so keep that in mind here. I'm not using Vercel because that's just.. More than what I need, and I already have good enough hosting for stuff like this.
